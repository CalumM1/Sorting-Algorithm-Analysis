# Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis and Efficient k-Most Viewed Videos Finder

## Overview
This repository contains the Java code and report for **Assessed Exercise 1** from the Algorithms and Data Structures (ADS2) course. The project consists of two parts:

1. **Empirical Performance Study of Sorting Algorithms**
2. **Implementation of an Efficient Algorithm to Find the k Most Viewed Videos**

## Part 1: Sorting Algorithm Performance Study

### Implemented Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms were implemented and tested:
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Shell Sort**
- **Merge Sort** (including variants like Hybrid Merge Sort and Bottom-Up Merge Sort)
- **Quicksort** (including variants such as Median of Three, Dutch National Flag, and Hybrid Quicksort)

### Experiment Setup
- **Datasets**: The provided datasets (`int10.txt` to `intBig.txt`, `dutch.txt`, and `bad.txt`) were used for benchmarking.
- **Metrics**:
  - Running time was measured for each algorithm.
  - Experiments were repeated 10 times, and the average running time was reported.
